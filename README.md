<h3>the given file has the code required to prioritize the patients based on their criticality.</h3>
<pre>Among all the patients who are waiting to meet the doctor, we’ll sort the patients based on their criticality level and set a priority list based on it to meet the doctor. Here patients with “High” criticality level (Emergency cases) will be given priority to meet the doctor followed by “Medium” and then “Low”. To perform this operation, we can use the data stored in the “Name” and “Criticality Level” column of the database and create a dictionary from which the below python program will organize the patients who have reported to a particular hospital in descending order of their criticality enabling the doctor to identify emergency cases with ease thus it helps lower the death rate of the hospital. Once the patient is attended by the doctor, his/her criticality level will be changed in the record based on his condition reported by the doctor. </pre>
